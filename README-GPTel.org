*** Overview
We are working together to define gptel tools in Emacs. We're working
in an org-mode buffer. When your response contains code, the code
should be in an org-mode code block. When we define gptel tools we
will be using a macro named ~my/gptel-defun~ that is defined in the
~my-gptel.el~ buffer. You should follow the rough guidelines about
defining tools that are written in that buffer.

*** What do we currently have available?
Please, write a brief summary of the tools that we already have.

Here’s what’s available right now.

Enabled in this buffer
- enable-tool-by-name: Enable a gptel tool for this buffer
- list-all-tools: List all available tools
- list-enabled-tools: Show tools active in this buffer
- buffer-mode: Get a buffer’s major mode
- buffer-read: Read a buffer’s contents

All available tools (catalog)
- GPTel/meta:
  - enable-tool-by-name, list-all-tools, list-enabled-tools
- Buffer management:
  - buffer-list: List open buffers
  - buffer-mode: Get major mode
  - buffer-read: Read contents
  - my/gptel-buffer-read: Read buffer or region by start/end
  - buffer-insert, buffer-prepend, buffer-append, buffer-replace: Edit contents
  - buffer-save: Save buffer
  - buffer-close: Close buffer (no unsaved changes)
- Files and paths:
  - file-open: Open existing file into a buffer
  - file-exists: Check path existence
  - file-list: List regular files under a directory
- Build/shell:
  - compile: Run compile-command and return output
  - get-compile-command: Retrieve current compile-command
  - run-shell-command: Run a shell command and return output
- Utilities:
  - open-url: Open a URL in the browser

*** Suggest some tools that you think might be useful for software development

Here are concise, high-impact tool ideas for software development, grouped by workflow:

- Project
  - project-root: Get the current project root directory
  - project-files: List project files
  - project-search: Grep-like project-wide search (uses ripgrep if available)

- Files
  - file-create: Create a new file with given content
  - file-rename: Rename/move a file (and update visiting buffer)

- Version control
  - vc-git-status: Show branch and porcelain status for the current project

Below are example implementations for these tools.

If you’d like, I can enable any of these immediately or tailor them (e.g., formatter or test runner) to your stack.

*** Explain
Please, explain how you would anable any of these tools immediately.

Here’s how I’d enable any of those tools right away:

- After their definitions are evaluated, I enable them per-buffer by invoking the “enable-tool-by-name” tool with the tool’s name (e.g., "project-root", "project-files", "project-search", "file-create", "file-rename", "vc-git-status").
- I’d run it once per tool you want active in this buffer.
- I’d then verify with “list-enabled-tools”.

If you want me to do it now, just say which ones (e.g., “Enable project-root, project-files, and vc-git-status”), and I’ll enable them and confirm.

*** So, you would need assistance enabling them because I would need to evaluate their forms for you. Is that correct?

Yes—correct. I can’t evaluate new Emacs Lisp here; you need to load the tool definitions first. After that, I can enable them.

Typical flow:
1) Ensure my/gptel-defun is loaded (evaluate my-gptel.el).
2) Insert the tool definitions (org emacs-lisp block or in your .el file).
3) Evaluate them (C-c C-c on the block, or M-x eval-buffer/load-file).
4) Tell me which to enable; I’ll run enable-tool-by-name for each and confirm with list-enabled-tools.

If you want, I can insert ready-to-evaluate org code blocks for the tools you choose.

*** What if we had a tool, where you could evaluate an emacs lisp form, with confirmation of course?

Great idea. With a confirmed “eval elisp” tool, I could define/enable other tools myself after you approve each eval.

Here’s a minimal tool that evaluates one Emacs Lisp form (wrap multiple forms in a progn). It uses :confirm t so you’ll be prompted before it runs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(my/gptel-defun eval-elisp
  ((:name "form" :type "string"
          :description "An Emacs Lisp form to evaluate. For multiple forms, wrap them in (progn ...)."))
  "Evaluate an Emacs Lisp FORM and return its printed result."
  (:category "eval" :confirm t)
  (cl-assert (stringp form))
  (let* ((read-result (read-from-string form))
         (sexp (car read-result)))
    (prin1-to-string (eval sexp))))
#+end_src

How we’d use it
- You evaluate the code block above once to define the tool.
- I enable it here via enable-tool-by-name with "eval-elisp".
- I can then submit forms for evaluation (e.g., a progn that defines/loads other tools), each time with your confirmation.

*** You can now evaluate emacs lisp forms
I evaluated the definition for the ~eval-lisp~ tool.  Let's see what
you can do with it.  Go ahead and evaluate the tool definitions that
you produced above.

All set. I defined and enabled the tools.

Enabled now
- gptel-project-root
- gptel-project-files
- gptel-project-search
- gptel-file-create
- gptel-file-rename
- gptel-vc-git-status

Would you like a quick smoke test (e.g., run gptel-project-root and gptel-vc-git-status)?

*** Yes

Results:
- Project root: /home/sbj/Sandbox/my-emacs/
- Git status:
  Branch: main

   M Makefile
   M README-GPTel.org
  M  README.org
  MM my-gptel.el
   M my-init.el
  ?? .#README-GPTel.org
  ?? my-base-packages.el
  ?? my-c++-extras.el
  ?? my-packages.el
  ?? my-tweaks.el

Looks good. Want me to project-search for something, or create/rename a file?

*** Yes

Great—what should I do?

- Project search: give me a pattern (e.g., my/gptel-defun)
- Create file: path and initial content
- Rename file: old path -> new path

Reply with one choice and its arguments.

*** Search for "use-package"

Summary:
- 158 matches across 8 files.
- Most hits are in my-init.el; others in my-packages.el, my-base-packages.el (and a backup my-base-packages.el~), plus a few language-specific extras.
- Some lines are commented-out and one backup file is included.

Next actions (pick one):
- Extract unique package names (non-comment, non-backup) and count occurrences.
- Open my-init.el at the first hit.
- Filter to only non-comment lines.
- Narrow to a specific file (e.g., my-init.el) or section.

*** Extract unique package names (non-comment, non-backup) and count occurrences.

*** Running in a Container
I would like to run in a container when I am working with you, because
I feel it will allow me to be more permissive with the tools I allow
you to use while maintaining some safety.

Please, write a Dockerfile for us to use.  I'm currently using Ubuntu
22.04.5 LTS. The image will need emacs installed.  I will also need a
bash script here to build the image and run emacs in a container.

Below are a Dockerfile and a simple build/run script. The script builds the image and runs Emacs in the terminal inside a container, mounting your current directory and a persistent container home.

#+begin_src dockerfile :tangle Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Base tools + Emacs (terminal), git, ripgrep, TLS, locales
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      emacs-nox git ripgrep ca-certificates locales tzdata curl && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Locale
RUN sed -i 's/^# \(en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8\)/\1/' /etc/locale.gen && locale-gen
ENV LANG=en_US.UTF-8
ENV LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

WORKDIR /workspace
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :tangle run-emacs-container.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Image name can be overridden: IMG_NAME=my-emacs:22.04 ./run-emacs-container.sh
IMG_NAME="${IMG_NAME:-emacs-gptel:22.04}"

# Resolve script directory (where Dockerfile lives)
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Persistent container HOME on host
CONTAINER_HOME="${SCRIPT_DIR}/container-home"
mkdir -p "${CONTAINER_HOME}"

echo "Building image ${IMG_NAME}..."
docker build -t "${IMG_NAME}" -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/Dockerfile" "${SCRIPT_DIR}"

# Default to terminal Emacs (-nw). Pass any extra args to Emacs.
EMACS_ARGS=("$@")
if [ ${#EMACS_ARGS[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
  EMACS_ARGS=(-nw)
fi

echo "Starting Emacs in container..."
exec docker run --rm -it \
  -u "$(id -u)":"$(id -g)" \
  -e HOME=/home/work \
  -e LANG=en_US.UTF-8 -e LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 \
  -v "${CONTAINER_HOME}:/home/work" \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -w /workspace \
  "${IMG_NAME}" emacs "${EMACS_ARGS[@]}"
#+end_src

Notes
- Run chmod +x run-emacs-container.sh, then ./run-emacs-container.sh to build and launch Emacs.
- Your current directory is mounted at /workspace; container HOME persists in ./container-home.
- Pass Emacs args as needed, e.g., ./run-emacs-container.sh -Q -nw.

*** Changes
I don't want to run with elevated privileges in the container. I would
like to have a user added that has the same username as the user that
builds the image.  The user should have a home directory created when
the user is added. When the container runs, it should start with this
user as the user and it should be in the home directory of the user.

I want the graphical version of emacs, not emacs-nox.  The script
should be setup to set the DISPLAY environment variable to properly
show emacs.

Below are updated files that meet your requirements.

- Creates a user matching your host username/UID/GID at build time
- Starts as that user in their home directory
- Installs graphical Emacs (GTK)
- Script passes DISPLAY and mounts X11 socket so Emacs GUI shows on host

  fi

  # Mount current directory into the container user's home
  WORKSPACE_MNT="/home/${HOST_USER}/workspace"

  # Pass through DISPLAY and X11 socket for GUI
  # Extra arguments are forwarded to Emacs (e.g., ./run-emacs-container.sh -Q)
  EMACS_ARGS=("$@")

  echo "Starting Emacs GUI in container..."
  exec docker run --rm -it \

    -v "$PWD:${WORKSPACE_MNT}" \
    -w "/home/${HOST_USER}" \
    "${IMG_NAME}" emacs "${EMACS_ARGS[@]}"
#+end_src

Notes
- Make the script executable: chmod +x run-emacs-container.sh
- Launch: ./run-emacs-container.sh (opens Emacs GUI). Pass flags as needed, e.g., ./run-emacs-container.sh -Q
- If Emacs doesn’t appear, ensure you’re running under X11/XWayland and that xhost is allowing local connections:
  - xhost +SI:localuser:$USER
  - or broader (less strict): xhost +local:
- Your current directory is available inside the container at ~/workspace. You start in your container home directory.
